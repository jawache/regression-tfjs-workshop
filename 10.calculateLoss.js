/**
 *
 * We now combine the code for collectPoints and calculateLine.
 *
 * For each mouse click, (x,y) find the corresponding point on the line (x, y1) and then calculate the mean squared error from y and y1
 *
 * Basically calculate how far off all the mouse clicks are from the calculated line.
 *
 * If you click on the line the error should be close to 0, if you click far from the line the error should be higher.
 *
 * This is the "loss" function
 *
 * The best fit line is the line which has the lowest loss value.
